In this workshop, I learned how to create a copy constructor and copy assignment operator. Here I passed the reference of the object that needs to be copied as the parameter. I also learned about resizing the dynamic memory allocated. Since the steps were given so it wasn't hard to resize the dynamic memory. I learned how to create new temporary memory of the required size, later on, copy the original content into it, and then resizing the previous to the required size. In the end, delete the previous memory and set it to the new one. Moreover, I also learned how to make insertion and extraction operators with the help of ostream and istream, which helped me to directly assign a new value to an object and display the content just bypassing the object as the right-hand operand. I also learned how to open a file and then use it for extracting data and input new to that file. The file operations were a little bit difficult and which is why it took time to deal with that section, while other parts were easier and didn't cause any difficulty.
