In this workshop, I learned about constructors and destructors. Constructors are the special member 
function that objects request during the time of creation. A default constructor is used to execute a 
preparatory logic and that is set the object to an empty state. Where a destructor is the special 
member function objects invoke before going out of scope. Moreover, I also learned about the overloading 
of constructors which means that we have options to pass as many arguments at creation time. This 
workshop was pretty easier for me since most of the code and instructions were initially provided 
which made this workshop easier to solve. The second part of the workshop was a bit difficult since 
it involved the coding mostly after seeing the execution part which made it a little bit tough. Along 
with this I also added the flush keys function which was used in workshop 1 and is used to flush the 
keyboard and clear memory buffer.
