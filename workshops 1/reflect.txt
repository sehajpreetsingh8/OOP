I have learned the basics of C++ in classes and while completing the workshop I learned how to implement those basics. 
C programming is a lot similar to C++ along with I learned new topics such as namespaces and also some syntax changes comparatively to C programming. Although syntax was confusing to me in the starting and made it difficult for me to understand the code. However, with course notes and lectures it is now understandable.  Since part 1 was easier with which dividing the code was part of it but that part helped me to complete the part 2. In part 2 only a few functions were required to read the school code and print the extension number. Moreover, functions were similar to C programming so the knowledge of C helped in the completion of the workshop too. The part where I had a few difficulties was part where the code reads the file but was later tackled when I understand what is being done with other fscanf functions.
