In this workshop, I learned about operator overloading. Since we cannot use operators on class objects, however with the help of operator overloading we can do it. I learned how to define and create binary member operators where one object is the owner of the operator, which is the left operand and on the right side. For a single object, I learned unary member operators. I also learned the part where these functions help in type conversions of the objects by defining and creating type conversions. For the operators where the owner of the operator is not a member class, there I gained more knowledge on how to define and create helper functions. These functions can operate when both the left and the right operand is class or another function where one of those is a standard variable. Here the sign of the operator basically describes what the function will be. This workshop was easy to do since everything was clear, which lead to no issues for me while doing the workshop.
